# Election_Analysis

## Project overview
Assisted a Colorado board of elections in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. Tom, a Colorado election board member, needs assistance with an audit of the election results. Tom's manager wants to know how the vote auditing process can be automated using Python.

To determine the winner of the elections, votes will be counted from the three primary methods, punch cards, direct recording electronic (DRE), and mail-in ballots. The following tasks will be performed to complete the audit of the election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
